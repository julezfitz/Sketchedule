# VisuSchedule

VisuSchedule is a phone web app geared towards creating and using personal visual schedules. 

My inspiration comes from years of drawing on paper squares and affixing pictures to a board to guide my children through the day, allowing them to see what is coming next to help ease transitions. It was time consuming and the schedule was not linear, which sometimes created confusion. Some days, like school or daycare days can be repetitive, so I found myself frequently re-creating the same schedules. The aim of VisuSchedule is to allow people to quickly create and use simple linear visual schedules. 

VisuSchedule allows users to choose either personal photographs uploaded from their phone, choose photos from a searchable free use database of photos to use, or a combination to create schedules. Labels are optional on schedule items, as not everyone needs these. VisuSchedule has both schedule edit and view modes, so once a schedule is ready, view mode switches to a linear scroll from start to finish, allowing items to be checked off as they go. Once all items are complete, clicking the complete button cheers the users on a resets all items status for use again another time.

This project was built using React, Javascript, Dexie (local database) and Material UI, created to fulfill the requirements of the CS50 curriculum, as my final course project.
